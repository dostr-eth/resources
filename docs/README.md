# DOSTR ðŸ”˜

## Abstract

Dostr is an Ethereum-flavoured [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr#readme) client. Dostr is an optional Ethereum-native side-stack to Nostr which allows users to generate deterministic Nostr-specific private keys from Ethereum-native ECDSA signatures. This allows Nostr to function with Ethereum wallets and leverage properties of [ENS (Ethereum Name Service)](https://docs.ens.domains/) protocol in Dostr client infrastructure and vice-versa. Consequently, Dostr provides an optional side-stack of Ethereum-based services for Nostr users, e.g. allows them to use their ENS identity on Nostr or attach to [Helix2](https://github.com/helix-coupler/resources/blob/master/yellow-paper/README.md) as a submodule hook. Alternatively, Ethereum users may find that Dostr is a minimal implementation of [Sign In With X (SIWx)](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-122) - an alternative to SIWE.

## Introduction

Dostr is a Nostr client with Ethereum-based side-stack. To understand Dostr, one must understand Nostr. Nostr is a minimal peer-to-peer networking protocol with following properties:

- Nostr consists of **Clients**  and **Relays**. Clients are local instances run by users and relays are websocket servers which communicate between clients.
- Nostr clients have the ability to talk to relays and make requests for filtered information, which the relay fetches from another client and returns to the original requester.
- Nostr clients are identified by their private keys and may have a **Petname**. Nostr clients must sign the information they send and relays must validate the information before transmitting it.

More details about the Nostr protocol may be found [here](https://github.com/rajarshimaitra/rust-nostr/blob/main/VISION.md) (and [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)). In native Nostr implementation, Schnorr signature scheme over `secp256k1` is used as per Bitcoin-native [BIP-340 standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki#design). Dostr adds to this standard by deriving the Nostr-specific private keys from Ethereum-native ECDSA signature scheme outlined in [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) using HMAC Key Derivation Function (HKDF). In Dostr clients, ENS names of the signing wallets become the petnames of the users.

Implementing an Ethereum-based side-stack to Nostr has several utilities. Firstly, it allows Nostr to work with Ethereum-based wallets and leverage the rich UX of Ethereum ecosystem. For instance, most Ethereum-wallets implement ENS by default and Dostr is the first and only protocol that allows users to uitlise their [NIP-02](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/02.md) compatible ENS names on Nostr. Dostr further leverages properties of ENS such as its DNS resolution via a gateway (https://vitalik.eth.limo) to store [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) compatible public client information. The cross-chain utility of Dostr is not limited to ENS and extends beyond to other Ethereum-native naming and linking protocols such as (https://github.com/helix-coupler/resources/blob/master/yellow-paper/README.md) or [Woolball](https://woolball.xyz).

## Protocol Design

Dostr design is identitical to the Nostr specifications described in [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) except for two main differences -  using ECDSA signatures to derive user keys, and use of ENS via a gateway to access the user properties instead of a web2 DNS server. The detailed NIP-69 proposal covering these two aspects can be found [here](https://github.com/dostr-eth/nips/blob/ethkeygen/xx.md). In summary, the Dostr implementation can be summarised with the following pseudo-code.

### Private-key derivation

Dostr uses [HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869) coupled with `sha256`.

```js
import { hkdf } from '@noble/hashes/hkdf';
import { sha256 } from '@noble/hashes/sha256';
import * as secp256k1 from '@noble/secp256k1';

let username = 'petname@domain.eth.limo'; // chosen username as per NIP-02 and/or NIP-05
let optPassword = "horse staple battery"; // optional password
let address = wallet.getAddress(); // get checksum'd address from eth wallet
let signature = wallet.signMessage(message); // request signature from eth wallet (v, r, s)
let inputKey = sha256(signature);
let salt = sha256(`nostr:${username}:${optPassword}:${signature.slice(68)}`); // generate salt with username, password & signature
let info = `nostr:${username}:${address}`; // HKDF() arg
let dkLen = 42; // HKDF() arg
let hashKey = hkdf(sha256, inputKey, salt, info, dkLen); // calculate keyhash with HKDF function
let privKey = nobleSecp256k1.hashToPrivateKey(hashKey); // private key from (keyhash âŠ• secp256k1)
let pubKey = nobleSecp256k1.getPublicKey(privKey); // public key from (keyhash âŠ• secp256k1)
```

#### a) `username`

Nostr username can be either of the following:

`petname` or `petname@domain.eth.limo` or `domain.eth.limo` or `sub.domain.eth.limo`, where,

- `petname` is a name/identifier compatible with [NIP-02](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/02.md),
- `petname@domain.eth.limo` is an identifier compatible with [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md),
- `domain.eth.limo` is [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) equivalent of `_@domain.eth.limo`, and
- `sub.domain.eth.limo` is [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) equivalent of `_@sub.domain.eth.limo`.

Note that `petname` can be the same as `domain`.

#### b) `password`
Password is optional value used in HKDF salt,
```js
let username = "petname@domain.eth.limo"
let password = "horse staple battery"
let signature = wallet.signMessage(message)
let salt = sha256(`nostr:${username}:${password}:${signature.slice(68)}`);
// generate password if none provided by user
if(!password || password == ""){
   salt = sha256(`nostr:${username}:${signature.slice(68)}`)
}
```

#### c) `message`

```js
let message = `Login to Nostr as ${username}\n\nWARNING : DO NOT SIGN THIS REQUEST FROM UNTRUSTED NOSTR CLIENTS.\n${address}`
```
#### d) `signature`

```js    
let signature = wallet.signMessage(message); // request ECDSA signature from eth wallet in (v, r, s) struct
```
